# Web3 Audits, Publications, and Track records by ChainLight of Theori

This repository is a collection of publicly available publications issued by ChainLight in Theori.

Since 2019, we have been consulting the security of Korea's top 2 crypto asset exchanges, [Upbit](https://upbit.com) and [Coinone](https://coinone.com). As a result, we have entered the Web3 security market in earnest.
Unfortunately, most contracts for smart-contract audits and consulting have excessive NDAs, so it's a pity that we could not disclose most of our performance. However, even if we show only the publicly available parts, such as hacking competitions and bug bounties performance, you will know immediately that we are unparalleled. More things are coming soon!
